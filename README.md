- 👋 Hi, I’m @cCHRisB
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and making myself a better programmer in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make games using Unreal Engine
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game development and all the additonal non programming hats as well. (Even if I'm not good at it)
- 📫 How to reach me, don't have a proper twitter yet, when I do it'll probably lead from a different directory
