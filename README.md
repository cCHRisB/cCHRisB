# 👋 Hi, I’m @cCHRisB

- 🎓 OU 2020 graduate, now a software engineer at public corporations.
- 💻 C++ is my main jam, but I enjoy0 experimenting with other languages and tech.
- 🎮 Making Unreal Engine games—most projects are private for now, but that’s changing soon!
- 👀 Always learning, especially about game development and all the extra “non-programmer” hats it requires.
- 📚 Favorite games: The Binding of Isaac, Kingdom Hearts, Undertale (love a good story!).
- 📺 Big fan of animated shows.
- 🤝 I want to connect with new and experienced devs, share projects, and build small teams where everyone learns from each other.
- 💬 Let’s collaborate, chat, and make cool stuff together!
- 📫 I don’t have a public Twitter (yet)—but stay tuned for updates here.
